The first idea that popped into my head when I started to think about the myth of Sisyphus
was to make a life simulator where the user had to work to make money so he could buy food
and not die. Every time he would eat the hunger bar would go back down and so on. While
thinking about the aesthetics of that kind of website I started to think about these
advertisement traps that try to bait people to believe they just won something and then
show them multiple ads and force then to fill out forms. The base concept is very simple,
the user fills out forms and watches some ads and near the "end" the page refreshes and the
user has to start everything again. I think the counter that shows the progress of the
various steps is hilarious because there is no money to be claimed, but it tracks
the progress like something is going to happen. I also implemented a custom travel ad at the
end that advertises different traveling locations depending on the user's favorite food. I
thought it was a clever way to show a bit what these different forms are used for and what
advertisement companies can do with all of the information we give them. Finally, I decided
to add a glitchy aesthetic to my project to implement some sort of narrative to the
story. The more the user goes through the steps the glitchier the website becomes and in the
end the user is redirected at the beginning because the website "crashed".
