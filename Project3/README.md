Project 2
By: Xavier Touikan

ARTIST STATEMENT:

  I had a lot of trouble finding inspiration for this project, most
of my ideas had a level of interaction way too complicated for a web
project. In the end I wanted to talk about some of the videos that
seems like they are targeted for childrens but after a little while
they show some terrifying images and sounds / messages.

  The concept of my project is very simple, a parent asks the user
(the kid) if he/she wants to watch tv. If the kid says "turn it on",
the parent turns the tv on and after a few seconds there is a creepy
baby that appears on screen and says a mean message. The kid starts
crying until the creepy baby disapears. After the kid cries three
times the parent says "that's enough!" and turns off the tv.

  I wanted to also make a shoutout to parents who only stars caring
when their children starts crying too much, but don't even look at
what they are watching.

  A conceptual flaw with my project comes from the fact that I use
a tv as the screening device, but I try to display a youtube issue?
The problem with weird youtube videos have little to do with tv
channels so it doesn't make much sense that a kid will encounter
creepy things while watching tv or a ChuChuTV livestream.

  Altough I think my project is conceptually very weak, I enjoyed
creating this digital TV and I think the power button is very  
satistying. Using a youtube livestream for the iframe also helps
creating an almost immersive experience because it is like live TV.

  If I wanted to expand this project further, I would probably try
to search for real weird footage on youtube. I have been inspired
by the website astronaut.io, I think it is amazing and it is the
kind of experience that can only be created by youtube and the web.
If I could find a way to algorithmically reach these videos and chain
them on that little tv system I believe my project would be more real
and a lot more meaningful.

  I could also expend on the relationship between the kid and the parent,
there is a lot of possibility for relationship evolution. I didn't want
to go too deep into that because I have no idea what it is to be a parent
and I didn't want to seem condescending towards something I just can't
compare myself to.

  For me, this project is merely a small and funny experience that points
out a little subject happening on the internet without expressing any
moral judgement.
